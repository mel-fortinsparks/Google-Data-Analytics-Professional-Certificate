# Learning Log: Think about data in daily life

## Overview
By now, you've started to discover how powerful data can be. Throughout this course, you’ll be asked to make entries in a learning log. Your log will be a personal space where you can keep track of your thinking and reflections about the experiences you will have collecting and analyzing data. Reflections may include what you liked, what you would change, and questions that were raised. By the time you complete the entry for this activity, you will have a stronger understanding of data analytics. 

## Everyday Data
Before you write an entry in your learning log, think about where and how you use data to make decisions. You will create a list of at least five questions that you might use data to answer. Here are a few examples to inspire you:

- What’s the best time to go to the gym?
- How does the length of your commute to work vary by day of the week?
- How many cups of coffee do you drink each day?
- What flavor of ice cream do customers buy?
- How many hours of sleep do you get each day? 

Then, you will select one of the five questions from your list to explore further and write down the types of data you might collect in order to make a decision. That’s data analysis in action!

## Reflection
After you consider how you use data analysis in your own life, take a moment to reflect on what you discovered. Reflections may include what you liked, what you would change, and questions that were raised. In your new learning log entry, you will write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each question below:

- What are some considerations or preferences you want to keep in mind when making a decision?
- What kind of information or data do you have access to that will influence your decision?
- Are there any other things you might want to track associated with this decision?

When you’ve finished your entry in the learning log template, make sure to save the document so your response is somewhere accessible. This will help you continue applying data analysis to your everyday life. You will also be able to track your progress and growth as a data analyst.
